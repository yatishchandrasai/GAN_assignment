# QuickDraw Creative AI Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of:  
- Creative AI â€“ training DCGANs on QuickDraw sketch categories of increasing complexity: **smiley faces**, **swords**, and **cats**. Includes comparative analysis, learning-rate tuning, and extensions.

## Title

**Generative Adversarial Modeling of QuickDraw Sketches: A Comparative Study from Smiley Faces to Cats**

---

---

## Key Features

- Implementation of basic GAN and deep variants for synthetic data (sine wave, noisy parametric curve).  
- DCGAN implementation in PyTorch for image sketch generation.  
- Training on three QuickDraw categories: smiley faces (low complexity), swords (moderate), cats (high).  
- Learning-rate balancing to stabilize adversarial training.  
- Visual comparison of real vs. generated sketches.  
- Flowcharts for methodology and model architecture.  
- Analytical write-up on performance vs. sketch complexity, observations, and recommendations.
