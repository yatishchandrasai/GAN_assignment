# QuickDraw Creative AI Project

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of:  
- Creative AI – training DCGANs on QuickDraw sketch categories of increasing complexity: **smiley faces**, **swords**, and **cats**. Includes comparative analysis, learning-rate tuning, and extensions.

## Title

**Generative Adversarial Modeling of QuickDraw Sketches: A Comparative Study from Smiley Faces to Cats**
